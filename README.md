# SOFTWARE-ENGINEERING SYLLABUS
## DS405PC: SOFTWARE ENGINEERING [B.Tech. II Year II Sem.] 
## Course Objectives 
- The aim of the course is to provide an understanding of the working knowledge of the techniques for estimation, design, testing and quality management of large software development projects.
- Topics include process models, software requirements, software design, software testing, software process/product metrics, risk management, quality management and UML diagrams 
 
## Course Outcomes 
- Ability to translate end-user requirements into system and software requirements, using e.g. UML, and structure the requirements in a Software Requirements Document (SRD).
- Identify and apply appropriate software architectures and patterns to carry out high level design of a system and be able to critically compare alternative choices.
- Will have experience and/or awareness of testing problems and will be able to develop a simple testing report
